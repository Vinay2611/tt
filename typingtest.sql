(3, 'Twelve Resume Mistakes and Tips for a Good Resume', '2010-09-15', 'Yes', '<p>With 14.9 million people unemployed in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the pressure to get resumes in the &quot;yes&quot; pile is immense. Nearly half (48 percent) of human resource managers surveyed by CareerBuilder reported they typically review 25 applications or less for open positions. Thirty-eight percent said, on average, they spend less than a minute reviewing a resume; 18 percent spend less than 30 seconds. The CareerBuilder survey was conducted among more than 2,500 employers between May 18 and June 3, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make that can take them out of the running is a lack of customization. Seventy-nine percent of human resource managers said they pay more attention to resumes that are tailored to their open positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for the most memorable missteps they encountered when going through resumes, human resource managers and hiring managers reported the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate put God down as a reference (no phone number).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate listed her hobby as alligator watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate claimed to be a direct descendant of the Vikings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate&#39;s email address had &quot;lovesbeer&quot; in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate listed &quot;Master of Time and Universe&quot; under his experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate started off the application with &quot;Do you want a tiger?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate specifically pointed out that he was not a gypsy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate&#39;s condition for accepting the position was being allowed to bring his pet monkey to the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate pointed out, &quot;I&#39;ll have your job in five years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate sent a 24-page resume for a 5-year career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate put a picture of her cat on top of her resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate declared himself the LeBron James of table games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate sent a video trying to hypnotize the HR manager into hiring him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While it&#39;s important to stand out from the crowd, job seekers need to make sure their resumes catch hiring managers&#39; eyes for the right reasons,&quot; said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder. &quot;Job seekers need to communicate their relevant experience and utilize keywords from the job posting, while customizing their resume for each and every position. Focus on what you can bring to the table right from the get go.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haefner offers the following tips to get you started on your road to resume success:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quantify your experience - Have you helped increase client business, made significant sales or increased team productivity? Make every effort possible to quantify these experiences so you can show employers how you&#39;ve positively affected bottom lines in the past - and how you can hit the ground running at their organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep it professional - While it sometimes can be helpful to include personal achievements on your resume, leave off information that is too personal. Instead, focus on items that are business-related, such as volunteer work or membership in professional organizations. Also, make sure you leave emoticons, inappropriate e-mail addresses and cutesy fonts off your final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make it easy to read - Avoid using large blocks of text. Use bullets to break up text and make it easy for hiring managers to zero in on important points. Avoid using ornate fonts that may cause formatting issues when sharing electronically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help job seekers make the right impression, CareerBuilder offers professional resume writing services for every job level. Job seekers can also upload resumes and receive free feedback on how to create a personalized resume that is effective both online and in print to help improve their chances of getting hired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typing certificate showing your typing speed is also highly recommended, these days almost ALL&nbsp;jobs require typing for computer use etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', NULL),

I continue to admonish everyone who will listen and hear to read and reread Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, as well as literally everything else he has written.

Educators are missing the boat if they don&#39;t first of all guide their students in &#39;learning how to think&#39; by studying anything and everything written by Napoleon Hill. This will undoubtedly help them develope the right frame of mind in order to learn whatever pertinent information is necessary for their own personal achievement--and then they&#39;ll be able to go ahead and accomplish their most treasured goals and dreams. I now firmly believe we all were engineered for success by our creator; and infinite intelligence has always been available to anyone who is willing to persist in their quest to always become better today than they were yesterday in all areas of our oh so brief gift of life here on planet Earth.

The swelling may cause bumps to form on the tendon and the fingers to &#39;lock&#39;.</li>\r\n		<li>DeQuervain&#39;s tendosynovitis (pronounced du-ker-vanes ten-do-sin-o-vite-iss) is inflammation of the lining that surrounds the tendons in the thumb.&nbsp; This is one of the most common work injuries.</li>\r\n		<li>Trochanteric (pronounced tro-can-ter-ic) bursitis is inflammation of a bursa on the outer hip.</li>\r\n		<li>Housemaid&#39;s knee is inflammation of the bursa on the front of the kneecap.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</blockquote>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf you have repetitive stress injury the affected area may be tender, swollen, red and hot. It may be painful for you to move the area and it may wake you up during the night. The pain is usually not widespread throughout the body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a name="{0AB3C84B-AC50-11D4-BCC6-00D0B7474671}"><strong>What causes repetitive stress injury?</strong></a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bicipital tendinitis is often caused by using the arm to make repeated scrubbing motions.</li>\r\n	<li>Tennis elbow is caused by repeatedly bending the wrist backwards with force, such as when playing tennis or painting with a brush.</li>\r\n	<li>Golfer&#39;s elbow is caused by repeatedly bending the wrist forward with force, such as when pulling ropes or golfing.</li>\r\n	<li>DeQuervain&#39;s tendosynovitis is caused by repeated pinching or twisting of the wrist.</li>\r\n	<li>Housemaid&#39;s knee is caused by kneeling or leaning forward for a long period of time, such as when scrubbing the floor.</li>\r\n	<li>Some forms of tendinitis and bursitis may also be caused by diseases such as rheumatoid (pronounced room-a-toid) arthritis, gout, psoriatic (pronounced sore-ee-at-ick) arthritis, Reiter&#39;s (pronounced rlt-urz) syndrome, thyroid disease and diabetes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Repetitive stress injury is caused when too much stress is placed on a joint as a result of the same action being performed over and over.</li>\r\n	<li>Specific kinds of repetitive stress injury are caused by certain actions:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a name="{0AB3C8E4-AC50-11D4-BCC6-00D0B7474671}"><strong>What can you do about repetitive stress injury?</strong></a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If your doctor thinks you have repetitive stress injury, he or she may perform a physical examination and certain tests.</li>\r\n	<li>Treatment is done to reduce the pain and swelling and to keep the problem from getting worse.</li>\r\n	<li>Learn as much as you can about this condition.&nbsp; Speaking with your doctor or other people who are specialists in arthritis care can provide you with the information you need.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your doctor thinks you have repetitive stress injury, he or she will perform a physical examination of the area. There are no laboratory tests to confirm diagnosis of tendinitis or bursitis. Blood tests and x-rays may be done to ensure that other conditions associated with tendinitis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, etc.) are not the cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of treating repetitive stress injury is to relieve pain and swelling and to prevent the problem from becoming worse.&nbsp; Your active involvement in developing your prescribed treatment plan is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Medicine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs - pronounced en-seds) are often used to treat the inflammation of repetitive stress injury.&nbsp; These are a type of medication that helps reduce pain and swelling and decrease stiffness.&nbsp; However, they do not prevent further damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNSAIDs reduce pain when taken at a low dose, and relieve inflammation when taken at a higher dose. NSAIDs such as ASA (Aspirin, Anacin, etc.) and ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, etc.) can be purchased without a prescription. Examples of NSAIDs that require a prescription include Naprosyn, Relafen, Indocid, Voltaren, Feldene, and Clinoril. The various NSAIDs and Aspirin?, if taken in full doses, usually have the same levels of anti-inflammatory effect. However, different individuals may experience greater relief from one medication than another. Taking more than one NSAID at a time increases the possibility of side effects, particularly stomach problems such as heartburn, ulcers and bleeding. People taking these medications should consider taking something to protect the stomach, such as misoprostol (Cytotec).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Oral cortisone could also be prescribed if the swelling does not go away. Cortisone is a steroid that reduces inflammation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cortisone is a steroid that reduces inflammation and swelling and that can influence regulation of the immune system.&nbsp; It is a hormone naturally produced by the body.&nbsp; Corticosteroids are man-made drugs that closely resemble cortisone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common form of corticosteroid is called prednisone, taken in pill form. Prednisone use needs to be carefully monitored because of its many side effects, and the drug must never be stopped abruptly. Some of the side effects from long-term use include cataracts, high blood pressure, sleep problems, muscle loss, bruising, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), weight gain and increased risk of infections.&nbsp; The goal with this and most drugs is to find the lowest effective dose that will avoid as many of the side effects as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Your doctor might also inject cortisone into the affected joint. An occasional cortisone injection into an inflamed joint or tendon brings short-term relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Exercise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After the pain and swelling has been reduced, exercising can help you strengthen the joint.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Too much exercise, or the wrong kind could also make the condition worse.&nbsp; Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter the irritation and swelling of the joint has been reduced, it is important to begin exercising the muscles slowly so they do not become irritated again and to prevent loss of movement in the joint. Consult your doctor before beginning an exercise program.&nbsp; He or she may recommend you to a therapist who can show you the proper exercises to do. Before doing any exercise, or any other strenuous or repetitive activity, be sure to &#39;warm up&#39; your muscles first so they can better handle the stress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Cold</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Applying cold helps to lessen the pain and swelling.&nbsp; For example, put an ice pack on the area that is sore.</li>\r\n	<li>If you have a condition that causes you to have poor blood circulation, do not apply cold as it causes the blood vessels to shrink.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCold application can provide temporary relief of the pain of repetitive stress injury. Cold helps numb the area by constricting the blood vessels and blocking nerve impulses in the joint - this reduces the inflammation. If you have poor blood circulation as a result of a condition like Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon (pronounced ray-noze feh-naw-meh-non), you should avoid cold treatments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Protect your joints:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Be kind to your body.&nbsp; After doing heavy work, or doing the same task over and over, stop.&nbsp; Slow down by doing an easy task, or by taking a rest.</li>\r\n	<li>If you are doing a task for work or a hobby that may have caused your repetitive stress injury, change how you do that task.&nbsp; Find different tools that can make the task easier.</li>\r\n	<li>Use your back, arms and legs in safe ways to avoid putting stress on joints.&nbsp; For example, carry a heavy load close to your body.</li>\r\n	<li>Use helpful devices such as a cart to carry your grocery bags, or an enlarged handle that fits over a knife handle so you can hold it easily.&nbsp; A cart will help you to walk more safely.&nbsp; A grab bar, which attaches to a shower, will help you to get in and out of the tub more easily.</li>\r\n	<li>Consider getting a splint to hold your joint in a comfortable position at night.&nbsp; A splint can help decrease pain, swelling and stiffness.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protecting your joints means using them in ways that avoid excess stress. Benefits include less pain and greater ease in doing tasks.&nbsp; There are several techniques to protect your joints:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pacing, by alternating heavy or repeated tasks with easier tasks or breaks, reduces the stress on painful joints and allows weakened muscles to rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Positioning joints wisely helps you use them in ways that avoid extra stress.&nbsp; Use larger, stronger joints to carry loads.&nbsp; For example, use a shoulder bag instead of a hand-held one.&nbsp; Also, avoid keeping the same position for a long period of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many cases of repetitive stress injury are caused by using the wrong tools or equipment. Using the correct tools that keep you from having to assume awkward positions will help to prevent excess stress on your joints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using helpful devices, such as canes, luggage carts, grocery carts and reaching aids, can help make daily tasks easier.&nbsp; Small appliances such as microwaves, food processors and bread makers can be useful in the kitchen.&nbsp; Using grab bars and shower seats in the bathroom can help you to conserve energy and avoid falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting the sore area will reduce the irritation and speed up healing. For some types of tendinitis, splints are available that allow the joint to rest or minimize the amount of irritation to the joint.&nbsp; Your doctor will be able refer you to a therapist who can help find the best splint for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Relaxation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Relaxing the muscles around an inflamed area reduces pain.</li>\r\n	<li>There are many ways to relax.&nbsp; Try deep breathing exercises.&nbsp; Listen to music or relaxation tapes.&nbsp; Meditate or pray.&nbsp; Another way to relax is to imagine or visualize a pleasant activity such as lying on a beach, or sitting in front of a fireplace.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDeveloping good relaxation and coping skills can give you a greater feeling of control over your arthritis and a more positive outlook.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a name="{0AB3CB4A-AC50-11D4-BCC6-00D0B7474671}"><strong>Additional Tips for Living Well</strong></a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The Arthritis Society offers a variety of programs and services that can be helpful.</li>\r\n	<li>You can reach the Society at 1-800-321-1433 from anywhere in Canada.</li>\r\n	<li>You can also reach us through our Web site at www.arthritis.ca</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the physical symptoms of arthritis, many people experience feelings of helplessness and depression. Learning daily living strategies to manage your arthritis gives you a greater feeling of control and a more positive outlook. To get the best results, people affected by arthritis need to form close ties with their doctors and therapists, and become full partners in their treatment.

(8, 'Typing WPM', '2006-09-06', 'Yes', '<p>Words per minute is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in recruitment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWords per minute is also a measure of a telegraph or amateur radio operator&#39;s Morse code speed. Since the codes for different letters differ in length, one needs to specify a reference word. A commonly-used reference word is &quot;PARIS&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. So, &quot;fifth&quot; counts as one word, but &quot;fifteenth&quot; counts as two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an Afrikaans-speaking operator in Cape Town can be compared with a French-speaking operator in Brussels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomeone having minor experience with keyboards can reach 20 words per minute, an average typist reaches about 30 to 45 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), while advanced typists work at speeds above 60. As of 2005, Barbara Blackburn is the fastest typist in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Using the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, she has maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, 170 wpm for shorter periods of time, and has been clocked at a peak speed of 212 wpm. Blackburn failed her typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak keyboard in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA less common form of finding the speed of a typist, the acronym: CPM is used to identify the number of Characters Typed Per Minute. This measurement is not a common measurement of speed considering the difference between typing in different languages. This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person&#39;s typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. Also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is also a measurement that can be associated with older models of printers, but this is often not the case. The most common term associated with the speed of printers today is PPM (Pages per Minute).</p>\r\n', NULL);

Why would an employer accept a printed certificate from a test generated on your site when it would be simple enough to have someone with better typing skills take the test for the applicant?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA)<br />\r\nIf you are dishonest enough and find another as dishonest as that, then you could cheat, but what good would that do if you got the job? You would be found out eventually, so no point.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlso, like other online certification, we feel the use of credit card (that matches the test takers name) as pretty reasonable proof that it is the credit card owner who took the test.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n=================<br />\r\n(4)<br />\r\nQ)<br />\r\nWhat are the subjects of the tests and can I choose which I get?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA)<br />\r\nThe tests are chosen at random so there is a variety and are not likely to be memorized.

I was just wondering if your certificate is recognizable up in Canada?&nbsp;<br />\r\nI need to have a typing certification for the Royal Canadian Mounted&nbsp;<br />\r\nPolice and was not wanting to have to hit up a college.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A)<br />\r\nHmm, you need to ask them really. The police always want a 5 min test which we do. But they sometimes insist on the test being &quot;supervised&quot; which means someone watches the test, which we don&#39;t provide.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou may suggest that you do the test in their office while they watch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi, should I use one space or two after a period?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days it is accepted that just one space is used after a period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>===================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi Darren,&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs your typing certificate / test created using Mavis Beacon software?<br />\r\nIf so, does it state that on the certificate?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**No, it has nothing to do with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Mavis%20beacon&amp;tag=successbooks00&amp;index=software&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Mavis Beacon</a>&nbsp;other than we suggest it is&nbsp;<br />\r\ngreat typing software and recommend it. .&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian</p>\r\n\r\n<p>============================================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Q)I have just finished two certification typing tests.&nbsp; I printed two of them, which is required for an appointment I have.&nbsp; This appointment says minimun required wpm of 45, which I met but &quot;after&quot; errors, the certificate says uncorrected.&nbsp; Does this mean this certificate would not be valid for what I am needing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-diane white</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relax, it has been corrected, all that matters is the NET score, you typed at 55WPM which is very good.&nbsp;<br />\r\nYou can tell any employer to email me about you certificate and we can verify your score. Or even show them this email if needed.&nbsp;<br />\r\nSee copy of certificate attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheers Ian</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re awesome!&nbsp; I tried to leave a positive comment on your website, but did not find a customer testimonial section.<br />\r\nThanks so much!<br />\r\n--Tracie S</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks Tracie, glad we could help ; )<br />\r\nCheers Ian</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n======================================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this recognized in Canada? If you are saying it is, and I don&#39;t get recognition from the Police department or government offices, then do you reimburse my fee?
